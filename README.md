This is a [dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) app that allows users to visualitze their expenses and/or incomes.

**It is intended only for personal use.** There is another repository ([expensor](https://github.com/villoro/expensor)) with a similar dash app for public use.

It takes personal information from dropbox and uses dash login to verify the identity.
